You might know what an ETF is, you might already have substantial money invested in it,
but if you are a little like me (an engineer) you are intereseted in how these financial
instruments work under the hood.

This blog answers questions like:
- If ETFs are traded on exchange, how are they steered so their price follows some index
- Why are ETFs so low comission

Pseudocode with callbacks like:
- start of the day
- end of the day
- ETF creation
